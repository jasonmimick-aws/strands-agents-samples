    "Welcome to this tutorial on integrating Supabase with Strands AI agents! In this notebook, you'll learn how to leverage Supabase's powerful backend services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build intelligent agents that can interact with your database, storage, and edge functions.\n",

    "## What is Supabase?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides all the backend services you need to build a product:\n",

    "- PostgreSQL database\n",
    "- Authentication\n",
    "- Instant APIs\n",
    "- Edge Functions\n",
    "- Realtime subscriptions\n",
    "- Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Supabase MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Supabase's implementation of a standardized interface that allows AI models to interact directly with Supabase services. It enables Strands AI agents to seamlessly access and manipulate your Supabase database, storage, authentication, and edge functions through natural language instructions. With Supabase MCP, you can build AI agents that can query your PostgreSQL database, manage files in storage, and trigger serverless functions without writing complex integration code for each specific operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Strands?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Strands Agent Framework enables rapid development of AI agents with minimal code. Strands facilitates building highly dynamic agents through natural language, leveraging prompt engineering to generate varied output types and accept diverse natural language inputs seamlessly.\n",

    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:\n",
    "- Connect Strands agents to Supabase using MCP\n",
    "- Perform database operations with natural language\n",
    "- Manage edge functions through AI agents\n",
    "- Handle storage operations with AI assistance\n",

    "1. The Strands agent receives a natural language request from the user\n",
    "2. The agent determines which Supabase service to use based on the request\n",

    "4. The Supabase MCP server executes the request against the Supabase API\n",
    "5. The Supabase API interacts with the requested service (Database, Storage, or Edge Functions)\n",
    "6. The results are returned to the agent, which formats them for the user\n",
